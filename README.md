# Sentiment-Analysis-ANN-model-
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Arabic text data. The goal is to classify user-generated content (e.g., reviews or social media posts) into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

🧠 Model Overview

Architecture: Simple feed-forward ANN with embedding layer, hidden dense layers, and output layer using softmax activation.

Language: Arabic

Task: Text classification (sentiment analysis)

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

📊 Dataset

A publicly available Arabic sentiment dataset (e.g., Twitter, hotel reviews, or other labeled sources).

The dataset was preprocessed using tokenization, stopword removal, and padding.

⚙️ Features

Custom Arabic text preprocessing pipeline

Word embeddings (optional: pretrained like AraVec or custom)

Train/validation/test split with accuracy and loss tracking

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

🔍 Use Cases

Understanding public opinion

Monitoring customer feedback

Analyzing user reviews in Arabic
